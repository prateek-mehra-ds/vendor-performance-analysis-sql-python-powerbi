# Overview

This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for
purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL,
Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.

# Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector. This project aims to:
- Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments
- Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits
- Analyze the cost—benefit of bulk purchasing
- Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies
- Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability

# Dataset

- dataset link is in '/data/' folder consists of zip file in which (sales, inventory, vendors) csv files are compressed.
- Sumary table created from ingested data and used for analysis

# Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Common Table Expressions, Joins, Filtering)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Power BI (Interactive Visualizations)
- GitHub

# Data Cleaning & Preparation

-  Removed transactions with:
 - Gross Profit ≤ 0
 - Profit Margin ≤ 0
 - Sales Quantity = Ø
- Created summary tables with vendor-level metrics
- Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Negative or Zero Values Detected:**
 - Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)
 - Profit Margin: Min -∞ (sales at zero or below cost)
 - Unsold Inventory: Indicating stow—moving stock

**"Outliers Identified:"**
 - High Freight Costs (up to 257K)
 - Large Purchase/Actuat Prices

**"Correlation Analysis:"**
 - Weak between Purchase Price & Profit
 - Strong between Purchase Qty & Sates Qty (O.999)
 - Negative between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.179)
